#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is the systematic aplication of engineering principles,methods and tools to the
development and maintenance of high-quality systems.

its importance to the to industry is that it enables creation of software applications and systems
that power various aspects of modern life ranging from commerce,engineering,entertainment and healthcare


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. development of programming languages such as Fortran and C in the early 1960s
2. Advent of structured programming in the 1970s
3. Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
They include:
1.Gathering user needs and system requirements for development of software products.
2.creating high-level and detailed designs of software products for user experience
3. writing code and buuilding sftware according to the requirements
4.conducting various tests to ensure software products meets the design standards and functional requirements.
5.Deployment - releasing software products to the consumer/user.
6.maintenance- includes providing ongoing support,updates and enhanvements to the software products after deployments.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases while Agile involves iterative and increnmental approach focused on flexibility,and collaboration throughout software creation


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer - writes code for implementting software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager - oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software products.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

 IDEs - provide tools for writting,debugging and testing code. In Example Pycharm,Intelij IDE

 VCS - provide tools for tracking changes from source code and co-ordination among project members


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

challengess include:
  changing requirements
  tight deadlines
  technical debts

to overcome the mentioned challenges this can be done:
  effective communication channesls
  implementing agile methodologies
  Assigning priority to tasks as per their priority level
  continous project goals and timelines reassement

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt engineering includes-  crafting questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from  AI assistant such as copilot and Chatgpt

its importance include: helps in improving the interaction between humans and AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

giving an example such as as Tell me about the history of  cats can be vague since it is not specific and the AI model may not give the desired questions
to correct the above statement its good to re frame it this way tell me about the history of domestic cats.
In this case its specific on domestic cats unlike the first prompt
